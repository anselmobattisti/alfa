# Docker

You need a docker host with the API enabled! 

To do it

1 - Navigate to /lib/systemd/system in your terminal and open docker.service file vi /lib/systemd/system/docker.service
2 - Find the line which starts with ExecStart and adds -H=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 to make it look like
3 - ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H=fd:// -H=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375
4 - Save the Modified File
5 - Reload the docker daemon: systemctl daemon-reload
6 - Restart the container: sudo service docker restart
7 - Test if it is working by using this command, if everything is fine below command should return a JSON

curl http://localhost:2375/images/json

Important!

Configure the docker API to port: 2375

# To run the API

You need the docker and docker-compose instaled in your machine.

docker-compose up

To API access the Docker API is necessary that it started with this feature

Edit the file sudo vi /lib/systemd/system/docker.service

Modify the line that starts with ExecStart to look like this:
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker daemon -H fd:// -H tcp://0.0.0.0:4243

systemctl daemon-reload
sudo service docker restart
curl http://localhost:4243/version
