# Requirements

## Docker

You need a hostwith docker installed AND the API MUST BE enabled! 

To enable the API do it

1 - Navigate to /lib/systemd/system in your terminal and open docker.service file vi /lib/systemd/system/docker.service
2 - Find the line which starts with ExecStart and adds -H=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 to make it look like
3 - ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H=fd:// -H=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375
4 - Save the Modified File
5 - Reload the docker daemon: systemctl daemon-reload
6 - Restart the container: sudo service docker restart
7 - Test if it is working by using this command, if everything is fine below command should return a JSON

curl http://localhost:2375/images/json

Important!
Be default the docker API to port: 2375 if you need another port then change the configuration at api/config/dev.env
